## System Architecture

The e-Samwad application follows a hybrid architecture combining MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) patterns. Dependency Injection (DI) and Reactive Extensions (RX) are used for improved development and maintainability. The application is divided into different Android modules to ensure reusability and offline-enabled features are synchronized using Work Manager.

## Integration

The e-Samwad application integrates with various services and APIs, including Hasura for specific modules requiring backend interactions, FusionAuth for user management, login, registration, and token creation functionalities, Posthog for logging services, Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting and analytics, and SMS services for sending notifications.

## Roles & Permissions

The e-Samwad application consists of high-level roles such as teacher, principal, and school, along with various lower-level designations. 
Each user is assigned an authentication token upon login, which filters the results on both API layers and Hasura calls based on the role mapped in the JWT. These tokens are generated by the User Service, which acts as a wrapper on top of FusionAuth.
