These SMS can be sent in a decentralized manner by government school teachers for sharing daily attendance, homework status, exam results, notifications for holidays with the parents. e-Samwad has been used by 7,828 schools in the state to reach out to 80,636 parents, sending out 1.3 lakh messages. Once schools reopen, all 15,000+ schools in HP are expected to start using e-Samwad.",
